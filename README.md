#**DSA 210 Proposal: Analysis of the Relationship between Instagram and WhatsApp Usage Times - Merve GÃ¼n**

##**1. Motivation**

In daily life, the amount of time spent by individuals on social media platforms reflects their digital behavior. Among the most popular platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp serve different yet interrelated purposes, namely content consumption and communication, respectively. This study will try to analyze my personal social media usage habits to find out the correlation between Instagram and WhatsApp usage times.

This analysis is done with the aim of achieving the following:

Understand my digital behavior better.
Know patterns in my social media use that will help me have balanced habits.
Offer a case study that can encourage broader investigations.

##**2. Data Source**

The data for this work will be self-collected and analyzed as follows:

**Data Collection Process**
Usage Tracking: The daily usage times for Instagram and WhatsApp will be recorded using the Digital Wellbeing feature on my Android or Screen Time on iOS smartphone. Duration: Data collection will last for at least 14 consecutive days.
Manual Notes: In instances where app-specific features are not detailed in showing usage times, this will be supplemented by manual tracking-for example, differentiating time spent messaging versus consuming content. 

**Data Features**
Variables: Instagram usage time (in minutes) and WhatsApp usage time (in minutes).
Daily Records: Two data points (Instagram and WhatsApp usage times) will be collected per day.
Context Notes: Special circumstances (e.g., holidays, busy workdays) that could affect usage patterns will be noted daily.

##**3. Data Analysis**

##**3.1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Remove incomplete or inconsistent data entries.
Normalize time units (all times will be converted to minutes).
Handle anomalies: for example, very high usage times may be excluded or explained.

##**3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Calculate descriptive statistics of Instagram and WhatsApp usage time with mean, median, and standard deviation.
Visualize data distributions by plotting histograms and box plots of the data sets.

##**3.3 Correlation Analysis**

Pearson Correlation: Assess the linear relationship in the use of time between Instagram and WhatsApp.
Spearman Correlation: Assess any non-linear relationships.
Scatter plots with regression lines will be created to visualize the relationship between the two variables. 

##**3.4 Additional Analyses**

Examine changes in usage patterns between weekdays and weekends.
Analyze trends or outliers that may indicate unusual behavior during the data collection period.

##**3.5 Tools and Methods**

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn will be used for data analysis and visualization.
Excel or Google Sheets: As an alternative for simpler calculations and visualizations. 

##**4. Expected Outcomes**

If the correlation is significant, then the nature of the correlation-whether it is positive, negative, or neutral-will be identified.
Knowledge of my habits of using social media to help me in strategizing for balanced digital behavior.
The findings will form a basis on which more personal or wider usage patterns can be explored.
This is a proposal for self-analysis. In case further assistance is needed in data analysis or visualization, I am open to collaboration and guidance.
